Priorities is the way the PriorityQueue will execute queued commands. There usually isn't a backlog, but incase two commands come in simultaneously, the Queue can handle which one to execute first. The way it determines is an integer. The higher the integer, the higher the priority. Standard priorities should only need to go up to `4` for AutoNav.

<br/>

|LOW|NORMAL|HIGH|HIGHEST|
|---|------|----|-------|
|1  |2     |3   |4      |

<br/>

These are the numbers associated with the respective priority.
